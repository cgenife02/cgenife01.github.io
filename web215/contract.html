       <h2>Contract </h2> 
      <p>I, <a href="https://cgenife02.github.io/web215/introduction.html">Chuchu N Genife</a>, agree to abide by the terms in my Winter Semester WEB 215-N801 with my instructor, Prof. D.I. von Briesen.</p>

      <p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. 
     I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>

      <p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as an absences.</p>
